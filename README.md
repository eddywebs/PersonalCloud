## Personal Cloud

Personal cloud is a Raspberry Pi OS image based on raspbian (debian wheezy), it comes with dropbox clone (ownCloud), a download manager (aria2) and a MiniDLNA /UPnP media server.

Flash the image and connect a hard drive to your raspberry pi and have full media server, a download box and web file manager ready with minimal configuration.

## Motivation

Dropbox requires a subscription fee for any large storage limit, initiating a file download away from home computer is can be challenging. 
Having a dedicated media server apears to be an expensive or techincal propostion for many.

All the above achieved with<$50 (excludes external storage cost).
No subscription fee ! minimal techincal skills required.


## Installation
